\heading{Continuous Integration}
\small Merge Frequently; Don't push broken code; Don't push untested code; Don't push when the build is broken; If the build is broken, fix it\\

\heading{Test-Driven Development}
\small A software development methodology based on: Short development iterations, Satisfying pre-prepared test cases. An independent offshoot of Agile methodologies. Based on using automated unit testing to drive software development.
\subsubheading{How Many Tests?}
\small Test or both black-box and glass-box. As the programmer add glass-box tests for: Conditionals, Loops, Operations, Polymorphism.

\subheading{Test-Driven Dev: Red, Green, Refactor}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Cycle.png}
\small Applying Test-Driven Development relies on the existence of an automated unit testing environment. You are obliged to maintain a suite of test cases. Code must not be released until is has associated tests. The test are written \textbf{before} the code.
\end{multicols}
\subheading{Refactoring}
\small Code that needs refactoring has: Duplication, Unclear intent, Tight coupling, Pure data classes, Over-sized or under-sized classes, Complex or long methods, Switch statements instead of polymorphism.
\subheading{Mocking}
\small\textbf{\firstletter{D}ummies} - test objects which are never used but exist only to satisfy syntactic requirements\\
\small\textbf{\firstletter{S}tubs} - test objects whose methods return fixed values, and support the specific test cases only\\
\small\textbf{\firstletter{F}akes} - test objects whose methods work but have only limited functionality\\
\small\textbf{\firstletter{M}ocks} - test object which know how they're meant to be used, e.g. the sequence in which their methods should be called (allowing behavioural verification instead of just state verification)

\heading{Pair Programming}
\small Constant review from two people ensures fewer defects. Works well for mentoring: inexperienced staff, new team members, learning new techniques or tools.\\
\small\textbf{\firstletter{D}river} - person at the keyboard\\
\small\textbf{\firstletter{N}avigator} - focusing on design\\
\small Both need to be actively engaged - keep a running commentary\\
\small Switch roles frequently - every few minutes
\subheading{Ping-Pong Programming}
\small Driver writes a failing unit test. Driver \& Navigator switch roles. New driver implements code to pass test - then write a new failing unit test. Switch roles again

\small Navigability; arrow in direction of usage, no arrow is bi-directional. Multiplicity; min..max (or n), * is unlimited.
\subheading{Aggregation}
\small Strong relationship ``has a''. Hollow diamond
\subheading{Composition}
\small Strong relation ``is part of''. When composite is destroyed so is the part coincident life-span. Filled diamond
\subheading{Inheritance/Subtyping}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{inheritance.png}
\small Generalisation/Specialisation: solid line, hollow arrow head. Implements: dashed line, hollow arrow head. Italics == abstract.
\subheading{Packages}
\small Dashed line = dependency. Solid line = Nesting

\heading{Design Patterns}
\small Apply at various levels of abstraction. Are not reusable classes. Are not complex, domain-specific designs. Are limited in scope. Capture design intent, but not the full detail.
\subheading{Common Language}
\small Provide a common language for describing solutions; Each window is a composite - with decorators providing titles and scroll bars, To save memory - each image is a flyweight.
\subheading{Pattern Form (GOF)}
\small Pattern Name - short descriptive moniker and any aliases. Intent - short statement summarizing what problem it solves. Motivation - scenario that describes a problem this pattern solves. Applicability - how to identify when to use this pattern. Structure - description of class relationships and the object interactions. Participants - classes making up the pattern and their responsibilities. Collaborations - how the classes collaborate to perform their responsibilities. Consequences - benefits and trade-offs of using the pattern. Implementation - hints for implementing the pattern (consider language specific issues). Known Uses - examples of the use of this pattern in real systems (the Rule of Three). Related Patterns.
\subheading{Common Patters}
\subsubheading{Singleton}
\small\textbf{Intent:} Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it (\texttt{getInstance()} function)
\subsubheading{Observer}
\small\textbf{Intent:} Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.\\
\small\textbf{Consequences:} Loose coupling between Subject and Observer, Broadcast communication.
\subsubheading{Composite}
\small\textbf{Intent:} Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.\\
\small\textbf{Examples:} Menu Bars, Graphics.
\subsubheading{Command}
\small Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests.
\subsubheading{Visitor}
\small Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
\subsubheading{State}
\small Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
\subsubheading{Lazy Loading}
\small Avoid creating a large/complex/expensive object until you actually need it. Create a placeholder object that can be substituted out when the real object is actually needed.\\
\small\textbf{Proxy} - loads real object when data is accessed then forwards messages to real object (delegates).\\
\small\textbf{Ghost} - real object is created but without any data. Loads data when a method is invoked.
\subsubheading{Radial Menus}
\small\textbf{Intent:} Present user commands or choices radiating out from a central point.\\
\small\textbf{Similar Patterns:} Icons instead of Text.\\
\small\textbf{Advantages:} Shorter average distance to each item, greater distance between each item, faster interaction for expert users, works well for selecting graphical options.\\
\small\textbf{Disadvantages:} Doesn't scale/nest as well as vertical menus (best for 3-12 items or so), not as intuitive to read for the novice user, less familiar, text has to remain horizontal.
\subheading{Anti-Patterns}
\small Some things look like patterns, but make things worse, not better. Knowing these is almost as valuable as knowing the ``good'' patterns.

\heading{Code Smells}
\small Code smells refer to any symtom in the source code that could possibly indicate a deeper problem. Code smells are not the problem. They do not produce compile errors and are not even bugs. Simply, they are evidence that there might be a bug or other issue nearby.
\subheading{Code Smells V Anti-Patterns}
\small Code smells are not the problem, however the benefit of understanding code smells is to help you discover and correct the anti-patterns and bugs that are the real problems.

\heading{User-Centered Design}
\small Understand -> Define -> Ideate(Sketch) -> Prototype -> Test -> Deliver!

% \heading{Debugging Process}
% \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{DebugProcess.png}

\heading{Logging}
\subheading{java.util.logging}
\small Levels: SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST (in order, also OFF and ALL). Level of the logger is a cutoff for recording messages
\subheading{Log4J}
\small Levels: FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE (also OFF, ALL)
\subheading{slf4j}
\small Brings all the loggers together, enabling switching during runtime or on compilation. Avoids every library having its own logging facility. Uses all the log levels of log4j but FATAL.

\heading{System}
\small Jenkins -- Builds the changes to the repo; SonarQube -- checks for codesmells and code errors; Gradle -- For testing and running on local machine\\

\heading{JDBC(Java DataBase Connectivity)}
\small Standard library for relational databases. Standardises: Connecting, Queries and Updates, Results. Does not standardize SQL syntax (Sends strings).
\subheading{Drivers}
\small JDBC Driver Manager - Communicates with vendor-specific drivers that perform the real communication with the database.
\subheading{Plan for changes}
\small Limit data access to single area of code and don't distribute JDBC calls throughout the code. Don't return JDBC-specific objects from the data-access layer (Return ordinary Java Objects).
% \subheading{Basic Steps}
% \textbf{1.} Define the Connection URL\\
% \textbf{2.} Establish the Connection\\
% \textbf{3.} Create a Statement object\\
% \textbf{4.} Execute a query\\
% \textbf{5.} Process the results\\
% \textbf{6.} Close the connection\\

\heading{Apache Derby}
\small Written in Java. Good for small/medium applications (less than gig size, few queries/second). \textbf{Embedded mode:} Database runs in same VM as Java app. Does not accept network connections. Perfect for simple self-contained applications (easy setup). \textbf{Standalone mode:} Runs in seperate VM. Accepts network connections.

\heading{Prepared Statements}
\small Repeatedly executing query or update where format stays consistent, but values change.
\subheading{Advantages}
\small Move convenient than string concatenation. Much less susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

\heading{Advanced Features}
\subheading{Transactions}
\small By default, after each SQL statement is executed the changes are automatically committed to the database. Change with \texttt{connection.setAutoCommit(false);}
\subheading{More Features}
\small Stored procedures, Changing buffer size, Connection pooling, Hibernate/JPA and other ORM tools.

\heading{Flyway}
\small Store versions of database in metadata. Migrate from one version to the next using SQL or Java. Select database version in Gradle.

\heading{DBUnit}
\small Used for DataBase testing. Assumes there is a test database. Runs tests over the database.

\heading{JDBI}
\small Intermediate level relational database library. Methods map to single SQL statements.\\

\heading{JDBC v JDBI v JPA v JDO}
\small\textbf{JDBC:} Oriented towards database usage. \textbf{JDBI:} Oriented towards object usage. \textbf{JPA:} Focus on modelling. \textbf{JDO:} Focus on object modelling.
