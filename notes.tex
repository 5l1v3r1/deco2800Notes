Merge Frequently; Don't push broken code; Don't push untested code; Don't push when the build is broken; If the build is broken, fix it\\

\heading{Test-Driven Development}
A software development methodology based on: Short development iterations, Satisfying pre-prepared test cases. An independent offshoot of Agile methodologies. Based on using automated unit testing to drive software development.
\subsubheading{How Many Tests?}
Test or both black-box and glass-box. As the programmer add glass-box tests for: Conditionals, Loops, Operations, Polymorphism.

\subheading{Test-Driven Dev: Red, Green, Refactor}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Cycle.png}
Applying Test-Driven Development relies on the existence of an automated unit testing environment. You are obliged to maintain a suite of test cases. Code must not be released until is has associated tests. The test are written \textbf{before} the code.
\end{multicols}
\subheading{Refactoring}
Code that needs refactoring has: Duplication, Unclear intent, Tight coupling, Pure data classes, Over-sized or under-sized classes, Complex or long methods, Switch statements instead of polymorphism.
\subheading{Mocking}
\textbf{\firstletter{D}ummies} - test objects which are never used but exist only to satisfy syntactic requirements\\
\textbf{\firstletter{S}tubs} - test objects whose methods return fixed values, and support the specific test cases only\\
\textbf{\firstletter{F}akes} - test objects whose methods work but have only limited functionality\\
\textbf{\firstletter{M}ocks} - test object which know how they're meant to be used, e.g. the sequence in which their methods should be called (allowing behavioural verification instead of just state verification)

\heading{Pair Programming}
Constant review from two people ensures fewer defects. Works well for mentoring: inexperienced staff, new team members, learning new techniques or tools.\\
\textbf{\firstletter{D}river} - person at the keyboard\\
\textbf{\firstletter{N}avigator} - focusing on design\\
Both need to be actively engaged - keep a running commentary\\
Switch roles frequently - every few minutes
\subheading{Ping-Pong Programming}
Driver writes a failing unit test. Driver \& Navigator switch roles. New driver implements code to pass test - then write a new failing unit test. Switch roles again

\subheading{Aggregation}
Strong relationship ``has a''. Hollow diamond
\subheading{Composition}
Strong relation ``is part of''. When composite is destroyed so is the part coincident life-span. Filled diamond
\subheading{Inheritance/Subtyping}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{inheritance.png}
Generalisation/Specialisation: solid line, hollow arrow head. Implements: dashed line, hollow arrow head. Italics == abstract.
\subheading{Packages}
Dashed line = dependency. Solid line = Nesting

\heading{Design Patterns}
Apply at various levels of abstraction. Are not reusable classes. Are not complex, domain-specific designs. Are limited in scope. Capture design intent, but not the full detail.
\subheading{Common Language}
Provide a common language for describing solutions; Each window is a composite - with decorators providing titles and scroll bars, To save memory - each image is a flyweight.
\subheading{Pattern Form (GOF)}
Pattern Name - short descriptive moniker and any aliases. Intent - short statement summarizing what problem it solves. Motivation - scenario that describes a problem this pattern solves. Applicability - how to identify when to use this pattern. Structure - description of class relationships and the object interactions. Participants - classes making up the pattern and their responsibilities. Collaborations - how the classes collaborate to perform their responsibilities. Consequences - benefits and trade-offs of using the pattern. Implementation - hints for implementing the pattern (consider language specific issues). Known Uses - examples of the use of this pattern in real systems (the Rule of Three). Related Patterns.
\subheading{Common Patters}
\subsubheading{Singleton}
\textbf{Intent:} Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it (\texttt{getInstance()} function)
\subsubheading{Observer}
\textbf{Intent:} Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.\\
\textbf{Consequences:} Loose coupling between Subject and Observer, Broadcast communication.
\subsubheading{Composite}
\textbf{Intent:} Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.\\
\textbf{Examples:} Menu Bars, Graphics.
\subsubheading{Command}
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests.
\subsubheading{Visitor}
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
\subsubheading{State}
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
\subsubheading{Lazy Loading}
Avoid creating a large/complex/expensive object until you actually need it. Create a placeholder object that can be substituted out when the real object is actually needed.\\
\textbf{Proxy} - loads real object when data is accessed then forwards messages to real object (delegates).\\
\textbf{Ghost} - real object is created but without any data. Loads data when a method is invoked.
\subsubheading{Radial Menus}
\textbf{Intent:} Present user commands or choices radiating out from a central point.\\
\textbf{Similar Patterns:} Icons instead of Text.\\
\textbf{Advantages:} Shorter average distance to each item, greater distance between each item, faster interaction for expert users, works well for selecting graphical options.\\
\textbf{Disadvantages:} Doesn't scale/nest as well as vertical menus (best for 3-12 items or so), not as intuitive to read for the novice user, less familiar, text has to remain horizontal.
\subheading{Anti-Patterns}
Some things look like patterns, but make things worse, not better. Knowing these is almost as valuable as knowing the ``good'' patterns.

\heading{Code Smells}
Code smells refer to any symtom in the source code that could possibly indicate a deeper problem. Code smells are not the problem. They do not produce compile errors and are not even bugs. Simply, they are evidence that there might be a bug or other issue nearby.
\subheading{Code Smells V Anti-Patterns}
Code smells are not the problem, however the benefit of understanding code smells is to help you discover and correct the anti-patterns and bugs that are the real problems.

\heading{User-Centered Design}
Understand -> Define -> Ideate(Sketch) -> Prototype -> Test -> Deliver!

\heading{Debuggin Process}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{DebugProcess.png}

\heading{Logging}
\subheading{java.util.logging}
Levels: SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST (in order, also OFF and ALL). Level of the logger is a cutoff for recording messages
\subheading{Log4J}
Levels: FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE (also OFF, ALL)
\subheading{slf4j}
Brings all the loggers together, enabling switching during runtime or on compilation. Avoids every library having its own logging facility. Uses all the log levels of log4j but FATAL.

\heading{System}
Jenkins -- Builds the changes to the repo; SonarQube -- checks for codesmells and code errors; Gradle -- For testing and running on local machine\\
